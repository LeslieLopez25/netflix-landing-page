<h1>Netflix Landing Page :tv:</h1>

<h2>A Netflix landing page clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This website is responsive using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this following the tutorial of Traversy Media.  Screenshots of what the website looks like desktop and tablet. This a beginner friendly project and I got a better understanding of JavaScript to be able to change the tabs and different ways to use CSS.</p>
